Marked images used as start/end frames.

Please note that almost each image (but first and last) has been marked twice: once for first transition, once for second transition. For example: if you want to create transitions from A.jpg to B.jpg to C.jpg, you will mark couple A-B and then couple B-C, so you will have two different markings for central image "B".
